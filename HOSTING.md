# Hosting NodeSchool YVR

Are you interested in hosting NodeSchool Vancouver? We have a minimum set of requirements, and things other people have provided.

## Minimum requirements

* Seating and table space for 20+ people
  * Can be split into a couple rooms because we tend to split into smaller groups
* Wifi for 20+ people
* Power
* A plan for letting people into space. Most commercial offices have restricted access on weekends. This plan should include:

  * A sign: getting from the main entrance of a building to a space is more difficult to people who have not been there before. This applies to most attendees. Unless the path from main entrance to the space has no possible diversions, you need signs.
  * Elevator pass if needed.

## Nice to have

* Mentors
  * It's typically helpful to have people from your company/organization interact with members of the community. Participants find the contact supportive and a chance to discuss all sorts of technical, cultural, and experiential questions!
* Power strips
  * Some of the organizers have various power strips that can be loaned out if you don't have anything available
* Job postings
  * A large proportion of NodeSchoolers are looking for work (or open to the idea of changing roles)! It can be helpful to have a person who can talk a little about your company's open roles attending the session üíÅüèΩ
* Swag
  * Helps your company get remembered
* Whiteboards
