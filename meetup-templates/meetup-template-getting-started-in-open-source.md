A new session for the 2019 Winter is Here Series 🔥

This description is split into two parts, logistical details (bare minimum stuff you need to know like locations) and a meetup description. 

I highly recommend reading the logistical details, else you'll have inconvenient issues like not showing up in the wrong place. After that, the optional meetup description is for info about the session you're joining.

Cool? Read on 🙂

Logistical details

A note from **Clio** about how to get there:

**"Our offices are located at 300 - 4611 Canada Way, Burnaby, BC. (https://goo.gl/maps/zLYUqopikfN2) When you arrive, there will be someone to welcome you at the front of the building to let you in. Once in please come up to the third floor and select “NodeSchool” in our sign in system and it will print a badge for you. You will only need to fill in your name, and each person that comes into the space must sign in. There are free Clio parking stalls (11-15) just out front our building, as well as pay parking on Wayburne Drive. There are also Evo and Car2Go Car Share parking lots at BCIT, which leaves you with a quick 10-minute walk to our office."**

In open source, we create with open and distributed collaboration between peers. Contributors are the awesome people who make code or non-code contributions to a project! We'd like to make it easier for people to do this.

## Who is this for?

Whether or not you have contributed to an open source project, this is for you. Existing contributors will share practices of getting started contributing in open source. People who want to get started are coming to learn. Everyone will work on their open source stuff in a community setting and help other people do so too 💛

## Prepare

Bring your laptops and, if you can, have a Github account with a complete profile (photo, tagline) ready to go before you arrive. It's time for another session of learning!

## Mentors

We have ongoing mentors to help everyone learn. But we can't ever have too many people who want to help others learn, right?! So we always welcome new mentors.

## The Plan

* We'll walk through two different projects (https://github.com/nodejs and https://github.com/nodeschool workshoppers)
* We'll bring some issues we plan to work on. You can work on those with us
* We'll help maintainers respond to issues and requests
* We'll do our typical open source stuff and help people join in too

## See you soon!

If you want to learn and/or help others learn how to contribute to open source over a casual Saturday morning, RSVP yes!
