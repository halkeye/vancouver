# Meetup description templates

To use, copy the content into the event description on meetup.com and replace the bolded sections with deets relevant to the event you're scheduling.

Note that for now we're chunking the workshops into seasons. It makes it easier for us to plan and adds a dash of fun! December through February is Winter 🔥, March through May is Spring 🌻, June through August is Summer 🌦, and September through November is Fall 🍁.

Happy hosting! 💛
